On a brisk January morning in Silicon Valley, Tim Berglund and Baruch Sadugorsky got on a video call with Ted Neward, Simon Maple, and Viktor Gamov. We kicked off a new podcast with a panel discussion about the nature of developer relations.

This is not so much a highly produced podcast as it is a recording of a jam session between some friends who are passionate about training, developer advocacy, and community. It's like the prequel to the podcast that will be. And with the people on the call, _that is worth something_.

Here is that meeting:
