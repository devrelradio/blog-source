The site is built with [Hexo](http://hexo.io/).

* Clone this repo
* Run `npm install` (with npm itself installed)
* `hexo generate` to generate static files
* `hexo server` for a local server
* `hexo deploy` to push to the pre-configured GitHub Pages repo (must have SSH set up on the repo)
* Generally read the Hexo docs for whatever else :)
